## Discription
I travel a lot, especially when I have to travel to meet my families.  I have family all over the US.  My parents are in Massachusetts, my brother is in Arizona, and while a bulk of my friends are in Philly.  I need to know how's the weather like during my trip to visit them.  So, I created an weather dashboard that display any US city's current weather, and its 5 days forecast.

I wouldn't say this is this is the best code. I would like to clean it up a lot more but I just brute force it, and hard code almost everything.  I just wanted to finish this as quickly as possible so I can't spend more time on the main project at hand.

if I have time I would love to clean it up a lot more.
