# weather-call-API
## Discription
I travel a lot, especially when I have to travel to meet my families.  I have family all over the US.  My parents are in Massachusetts, my brother is in Arizona, and while a bulk of my friends are in Philly, and especially my cousins in Texas.  I need to know how's the weather like during my trip to visit them.  So, I created an weather dashboard that display any US city's current weather, and its 5 days forecast.

Diarmuid Murphy helped me out with the fetch request.  I almost forgot that without his major contribute I wouldn't of figured out that it must be contained in the function.

## What-I-would-like-to-do-or-try

I wouldn't say this is this is the best code. I would like to clean it up a lot more but I just brute force it, and hard code almost everything.  I just wanted to finish this as quickly as possible so I can't spend more time on the group task at hand.

if I have time I would love to clean it up a lot more.  I got to remind my self. 

I would also like to add a map function later on.
